<h2>About</h2>
<p>After a first study in fondamental mathematics at the University of Yaoundé I, followed by a master II in Analysis option Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) defended on November 2017, B. Wembe joined in 2018 the APO team (Parallel Algorithms and Optimization) at IRIT laboratory, Toulouse, France. He did a first post-master internship followed by a Ph.D. thesis in geometric optimal control defended on November 2021. This diversity of themes during his career offers him a solid background in fundamental mathematics (functional analysis, PDEs, optimization, dynamical systems, differential and Riemannian geometry, etc.) as well as in numerical analysis (direct and indirect methods in optimal control, finite differences, finite elements, etc.).</p>
